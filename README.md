# AdvancedLaneFinding_Highway280
This repository is used for advanced lane finding technique which I learned from Udacity's self-driving car nanodegree program 
and YOLO car detection, using YOLO object detection from example from littlegrass YOLO example for YOLO object detection.  The ipython 
scripts will take an input video, find the lane markers ahead, and identify the cars next to the ego vehicle.  The input video is taken 
from the border between Daly City and San Francisco in Highway 280.
